SpagoBITalendEngine's Change Log


======================= Release 2.0.0 2009-01-27 =======================

New features:

1. The engine has been modified in order to make it compatible with TOS-3.0.0. Back compatibility with 
previous versions of TOS is not guaranteed





Bug fixes:

none






Changes in template structure:

Now it is possible to specify the job version into the template. If version attribute is not specified the
engine will set job version equal to 0.1. Please be aware that the version number is important in order
to let the engine locate the job properly into its runtime-repository

EX. 

<etl>
    <job context="Default" 
    	 project="CRM_DEMO_V3"
    	 jobName="myExampleJob"
    	 version="2.0"
         language="java" />
</etl>
